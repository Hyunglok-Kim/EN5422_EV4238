        "Crime linkage attempts to determine if two or more unsolved crimes share a common offender. *Pairwise* crime linkage is the more simple task of deciding if two crimes share a common offender; it can be considered a binary classification problem. The linkage training data has 8 evidence variables that measure the similarity between a pair of crimes:\n",

        "- `spatial` is the spatial distance between the crimes\n",
        "- `temporal` is the fractional time (in days) between the crimes\n",

        "- `LOC`, `POA,` and `MOA` are binary with a 1 corresponding to a match (type of property, point of entry, method of entry)\n",
        "- `TIMERANGE` is the time between the earliest and latest possible times the crime could have occurred (because the victim was away from the house during the crime).\n",
